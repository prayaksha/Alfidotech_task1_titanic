Titanic Survival Prediction is a classic data science project based on the Titanic
dataset, which contains information about passengers who were on board the
Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a predictive
model that can predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic
disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.
